# customer_conversion_prediction
This project aims to predict customer conversion for an insurance company. Using historical data, we will develop a machine learning model that can identify which customers are most likely to purchase a policy. By understanding the patterns and behaviors of previous customers, the model can make predictions and provide valuable insight to the company. The objective is to increase the rate of successful conversions and ultimately improve the company's bottom line.

# key insights
– Analyzed historical insurance marketing data to understand patterns and behaviors of previous customers.

– Applied SMOTETomek to balance the dataset (45,000+ records) and enhance model performance.

– Selected Random Forest for its 0.904 cross-validation score to optimize customer conversion in telephonic marketing
